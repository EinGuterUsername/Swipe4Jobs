# Swipe4Jobs
A basic attempt to build a social network that’s a mix between LinkedIn and Tinder.

This project served as a hands-on exercise to build a social network using JavaScript, Node.js, Handlebars, and SASS.
MySQL was used as the database, and DOM manipulation was employed to dynamically update the frontend.

Sure, using a framework like Vue.js would have made things easier — but that would’ve taken the fun out of learning.

Unfortunately, I didn’t fully complete the messenger feature, and the live feed is currently just a placeholder.
However, everything else should be working as intended.
